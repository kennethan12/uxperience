- Ionic already provides elements that we don't have to create ourselves.

ion-content: actual page
ion-header: top portion

css vs scss
- css: add different rules on html
- scss/sass: (ionic) create more reusable variables, basically more useful

Put page into parent directory (app folder --> app.module.ts)
In app.module.ts, put page class into directory and entryComponents
